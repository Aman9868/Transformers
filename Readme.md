# Transformers are everywhere!
Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like text extraction,classification,summarizing etc. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:
  
  Amazon | Facebook | Microsoft | Grammarly | Musixmatch | Allen Institute for AI | Typeform
  
  
  The ðŸ¤— Transformers library provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The Model Hub contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub!
  
  The most basic object in the ðŸ¤— Transformers library is the pipeline() function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:
